Broken links and site errors often feel like minor issues.

A page doesn't load quite right. A link goes nowhere. Something that used to work quietly stops.

From a business point of view, these can seem cosmetic or low priority. From a search engine's point of view, they're signals that your site may no longer be reliable.

And reliability matters a lot.

## Search engines want to send people to dependable sites

Google's job is to send users to pages that are useful and work properly.

When it finds broken links, missing pages, or repeated errors, it starts to lose confidence. Not because it's being punitive, but because it doesn't want to send people somewhere frustrating.

Over time, that loss of confidence affects how often your site is crawled and how prominently it's shown.

## Broken links create dead ends

A broken link tells search engines two things:

1. The page it points to doesn't exist or isn't accessible
2. The site isn't being actively maintained

If there are a few broken links, the impact is small. If there are many, especially on important pages, it suggests neglect.

For visitors, broken links are frustrating. For search engines, they're a quality signal working against you.

## Missing pages waste trust you've already built

When a page that used to exist returns an error, any trust or relevance it built over time is suddenly lost.

This often happens after:

- page URLs are changed
- content is removed without redirects
- site restructures or redesigns

Search engines hit a dead end and don't know where to send users instead. That confusion reduces confidence in the site's overall structure.

## Errors make sites look unstable

Not all errors are obvious to visitors.

Pages might:

- load inconsistently
- return errors some of the time
- fail on mobile but work on desktop

Search engines notice this instability even when humans don't. If a crawler regularly encounters problems accessing your pages, it starts visiting less often and ranking them more cautiously.

## Slow sites compound the problem

Speed and errors are closely linked.

A slow site often:

- times out during crawling
- fails to load resources consistently
- delivers partial or broken pages

From a search engine's perspective, a slow site is unreliable. Even if the content is good, poor performance can drag rankings down over time.

## Why these issues often go unnoticed

Broken links and errors rarely announce themselves.

Your homepage still loads.

Some pages still work.

Customers don't always report problems.

Search visibility slowly declines without a clear moment where "everything broke".

By the time traffic drops noticeably, there's often a backlog of small issues quietly working against you.

## Fixing errors restores confidence

The good news is that search engines respond well to fixes.

Cleaning up broken links, resolving errors, improving load times, and restoring clear paths through your site sends a strong signal that it's being looked after again.

In many cases, rankings recover once reliability is restored.

## If your site has been quietly deteriorating

If your website has been through updates, content changes, or hosting changes and search traffic has dropped since, broken links or errors are a common cause.

I help businesses find and fix the issues that search engines see but owners often don't, so visibility can recover without guesswork.
