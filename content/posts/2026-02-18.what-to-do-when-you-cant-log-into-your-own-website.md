Realising you can't log into your own website is unsettling.

You know it's yours. You know you should have access. But the login doesn't work, the details are missing, or you're not even sure where you're meant to log in anymore.

This situation is far more common than people admit, and it's usually fixable.

## This rarely happens because someone did something wrong

The first thing to say is this: being locked out doesn't mean you've failed to manage your website properly.

Websites often pass through multiple hands over time. Developers move on. Emails change. Passwords get saved in old browsers. Systems evolve.

Access is lost quietly, not dramatically.

## Common reasons people lose access

Most lockouts come down to a few predictable causes:

### Forgotten or outdated login details

Passwords were saved on an old device, or tied to an email address no longer in use.

### The site was set up under someone else's account

A previous developer, agency, or staff member created the admin account and never transferred ownership.

### Hosting and website logins are confused

Logging into hosting isn't the same as logging into the website itself, and the difference isn't always obvious.

### Security changes after updates

Updates or security tools can block access, reset permissions, or change how logins work.

### The login URL isn't obvious anymore

Some sites hide or customise the login address for security, and that detail gets lost over time.

None of these are unusual. All of them have recovery paths.

## What you can try first

Before panicking, there are a few sensible checks:

- Search your email for past setup messages, invoices, or handover notes
- Try password recovery using any email addresses you might have used
- Check whether you still have access to your hosting account
- Look for any documentation from when the site was built

Even partial information can help reconstruct access.

## When self-recovery isn't possible

Sometimes the trail has gone cold. Emails are gone. The original developer is unreachable. Password resets don't work.

That doesn't mean the site is lost.

With the right access to hosting or the domain, it's usually possible to:

- regain admin access
- create new login accounts
- remove or replace old ones
- secure the site properly moving forward

The process just needs to be done carefully so nothing breaks in the process.

## Regaining access is also a chance to clean things up

Being locked out is frustrating, but it's often a useful moment to reset things properly.

That can include:

- ensuring you are the clear owner of the site
- documenting logins securely
- separating personal and business access
- setting up proper recovery options

The goal isn't just getting back in. It's making sure this doesn't happen again.

## You're not alone, and you're not stuck

Many business owners assume that if they can't log in, the situation must be complicated or expensive to fix.

In reality, this is one of the most common problems I help people with, and it's usually resolved faster than expected once the right steps are taken.

## If you can't access your own website, let's sort it out

If you're locked out of your website and not sure what to do next, you don't need to guess or stress.

I help businesses recover access to their websites, untangle ownership issues, and put sensible controls in place so the site is clearly and securely theirs.
