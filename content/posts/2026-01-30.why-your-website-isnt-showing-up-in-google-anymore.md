When a website stops appearing on Google, it often feels sudden.

Enquiries slow down. Traffic drops. You search for your own business name and don't see what you expect.

The natural assumption is that Google has "changed something". Sometimes that's true. More often, something small has broken quietly in the background.

Here are some of the most common reasons websites disappear from search results, without anyone realising at first.

## Broken SEO setups after updates

Many websites rely on SEO plugins or built-in settings to handle things like page titles, descriptions, and indexing rules.

After updates, those setups can break in subtle ways:

- settings get reset
- plugins conflict with each other
- features are disabled without warning

From the outside, the site still looks fine. Under the surface, Google is no longer getting the signals it needs to understand or prioritise your pages.

This is one of the most common causes of a sudden drop in visibility.

## Accidental "no-index" settings

One small setting can completely remove a site from search results.

A "no-index" tag tells Google not to include a page, or an entire site, in search results. It's useful during development, but dangerous if it's left on by mistake.

This often happens when:

- a staging site is pushed live
- a setting is toggled during maintenance
- a plugin update changes default behaviour

The result is dramatic. Google isn't penalising your site. It's being told to ignore it.

## Site errors that Google doesn't like

Google doesn't just look at content. It looks at whether a site is stable and usable.

After updates or hosting changes, issues can appear such as:

- pages returning errors
- broken links multiplying
- slow or failed page loads
- important pages becoming inaccessible

Visitors might still get through occasionally, but search engines are far less forgiving. Over time, these errors reduce how often your site is crawled and how confidently it's ranked.

## Content and structure drifting over time

SEO isn't just about keywords. It's about clarity.

As websites evolve, it's easy for things to drift:

- important pages get buried
- headings lose structure
- internal links disappear
- duplicated or outdated pages pile up

None of this causes an immediate crash. Instead, Google slowly loses confidence in how your site is organised and what it's actually about.

Visibility fades rather than vanishes.

## Why this often goes unnoticed for too long

The hardest part about SEO problems is that they're quiet.

Your website doesn't show an error.

Customers don't complain directly.

Everything appears to be "working".

By the time the drop in traffic is obvious, the issue has usually been there for a while.

## Fixing visibility is about diagnosis, not guesswork

When a site stops showing up on Google, the fix isn't to blindly add content or install more tools.

The first step is understanding what changed:

- settings
- updates
- errors
- structure

Once the underlying issue is identified, visibility often recovers faster than people expect.

## If your website has gone quiet, let's take a look

If your site used to show up on Google and doesn't anymore, something is almost certainly broken, not "just how things are now".

I help businesses diagnose and fix SEO and visibility issues caused by updates, settings, and technical problems, without jargon or guesswork.
