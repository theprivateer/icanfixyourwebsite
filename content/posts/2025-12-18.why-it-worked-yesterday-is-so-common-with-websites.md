title: 'Why "it worked yesterday" is so common with websites'

"It was fine yesterday."

That's one of the most common things I hear when someone's website suddenly stops working. It's also one of the most confusing parts of the experience. Nothing was changed. No buttons were clicked. No updates were run. And yet, something is clearly wrong.

It feels unfair. And a bit mysterious.

The reason this happens so often is that a website doesn't exist in isolation. Even when you leave it completely alone, the world around it keeps moving.

Modern websites are made up of layers:

- The website software itself
- Themes and plugins
- The server it runs on
- The browser people use to view it
- Security systems sitting in between

Each of those layers is actively maintained by someone else. They receive updates, improvements, and changes on their own schedules. Most of the time, those changes happen quietly in the background and everything continues to work.

Occasionally, they don't.

A hosting provider might update part of their infrastructure. A browser might release a new version that handles something slightly differently. A plugin developer might push a change that assumes a newer environment. A security rule might become stricter overnight.

None of these changes are aimed at your site specifically. They're part of the normal evolution of the web. But your website still has to live in that moving environment.

When everything stays compatible, you never notice. When one small piece falls out of alignment, something that worked perfectly yesterday suddenly doesn't today.

This is why problems often appear without a clear trigger.

From the outside, it feels like the site broke on its own. From the inside, it's usually a single mismatch in a chain of moving parts.

A form might stop sending emails because the server now requires a different method.

A layout might shift because a browser changed how it interprets a rule.

A page might error because a plugin now expects a newer version of software.

Nothing "wrong" happened. Something just changed.

This is also why websites benefit from ongoing care. Regular updates, monitoring, and small adjustments keep everything moving in step. When changes are applied gradually and deliberately, issues are caught early and are usually easy to resolve.

When a site is left untouched for long periods, the gap between "how it is" and "how the world now works" grows. Eventually, that gap becomes visible.

That's when "it worked yesterday" turns into "why is this broken now?"

Understanding this doesn't make the moment less frustrating, but it does make it less personal. A broken site isn't a failure on your part. It's a natural outcome of running software in an environment that never stands still.

The calm response is the same each time:

- Assume something small has changed
- Avoid making random fixes
- Get someone to diagnose the cause
- Bring things back into alignment

Most of the time, that's all that's needed.

Websites don't usually fail dramatically. They drift out of step.

And drifting is something that can be corrected.
