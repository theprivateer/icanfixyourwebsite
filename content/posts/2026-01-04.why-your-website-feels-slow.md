title: 'Why your website feels slow (and how that affects your business)'
---
When people talk about website speed, it's often framed as a technical concern. Something for developers to worry about. Something that matters to "SEO people".

For most businesses, it shows up in a much simpler way.

The site just feels slow.

Pages take a moment too long to appear. Images load in chunks. Buttons respond after a pause. On a good connection it's tolerable. On a phone, in the real world, it's frustrating.

That feeling matters more than most people realise.

Speed is part of trust. When a site responds quickly, it feels modern, cared for, and reliable. When it drags, visitors subconsciously question whether the business behind it is the same.

No one thinks, "This business is untrustworthy because their site took three seconds to load." They just feel a small flicker of doubt. Enough to hesitate. Enough to leave. Enough to try the next result instead.

Mobile users are where this shows up first.

Many visitors aren't on fast office connections. They're on phones, in cars, in cafes, between tasks. They're already juggling attention. A slow-loading page asks them to wait when they weren't planning to.

If your site takes too long to show something useful, many people won't wait. They don't complain. They don't email. They just go somewhere else.

That's a lost enquiry you never see.

Speed also affects how easily people move through your site. When every click has a delay, the experience feels heavier. Reading a service page becomes work. Filling out a form feels risky. Even small pauses add friction.

Friction reduces action.

Visitors are far more likely to:

- Abandon a form
- Skip reading important information
- Leave without contacting you

Not because they dislike your business, but because the experience feels harder than it should.

Search engines notice this too.

Google's goal is to send people to pages that provide a good experience. Slow sites don't just frustrate users, they signal that something isn't right. Over time, that can affect how visible your site is in search results.

This doesn't mean every slow site vanishes from Google. It means that, all else being equal, faster, more responsive sites tend to perform better.

Speed becomes part of competitiveness.

What makes a site slow is usually a combination of things:

- Oversized images
- Too many plugins or scripts
- Inefficient themes or page builders
- Outdated hosting
- Features that add weight without adding value

None of these are dramatic on their own. Together, they quietly drag a site down.

The frustrating part is that slowness creeps in. A site may launch quickly and then degrade over time as content grows, plugins accumulate, and updates pile up. Because it happens gradually, it's easy to adapt to it without realising what visitors are experiencing.

You know your site. You expect its delays.

A first-time visitor doesn't.

From their point of view, your website is competing with every other result on the page. Speed is part of that competition, whether you think about it or not.

The good news is that performance issues are usually solvable. In many cases, meaningful improvements come from:

- Optimising images
- Removing unnecessary features
- Updating or replacing heavy components
- Improving hosting
- Tidying up accumulated technical debt

This isn't about chasing perfect scores or shaving off milliseconds. It's about making your site feel responsive, calm, and trustworthy.

A fast site doesn't draw attention to itself. It gets out of the way.

And when your website gets out of the way, people are far more likely to do what you hoped they would when they arrived.
