title: "What to do when your website shows a white screen or error message"
---
Opening your website and seeing a blank white screen or a strange error message is unsettling. It feels sudden, technical, and out of your control. For many business owners, it sparks an immediate fear that something serious has gone wrong.

The truth is usually far less dramatic.

White screens and error messages are not signs that your website is "gone" or beyond repair. They're signals. They're the website's way of saying, "Something isn't quite right right now."

Most of the time, these issues come from a single, specific problem. An update that didn't complete properly. A plugin that's clashing with something else. A small configuration change that tipped the balance.

They look scary because they replace everything you expect to see. But they are rarely permanent.

A white screen often means the site tried to load and couldn't finish the job. An error message usually means the system knows something went wrong and is trying, imperfectly, to explain it.

Neither of these means your content is gone. They don't mean you need to start again. They don't automatically mean your site has been hacked.

They mean the site needs attention.

The most important thing to do in this moment is pause.

Resist the urge to click around randomly, reinstall things, or start updating everything in the hope that something fixes itself. Well-intentioned experimentation often makes recovery harder, not easier.

Instead, take a breath and do three simple things:

#### 1. Take note of exactly what you see

Is it completely blank? Is there a short message? A long block of text? A code? These details are useful clues.

#### 2. Check whether the issue is consistent

Try another browser or device. Sometimes the problem is local, not global.

#### 3. Look for recent changes

Did an update run? Did you receive an email from your host? Did anyone else make a change?


That's it. You don't need to diagnose the problem yourself. You just need to avoid making it worse.

Most white screens and error messages are resolved by:

- Rolling back a single update
- Disabling one conflicting plugin
- Correcting a small configuration issue
- Restoring a recent backup

These are routine fixes in the world of websites. They feel big only because they're unexpected.

From a technical perspective, this is closer to a flat tyre than an engine failure. Inconvenient, yes. Catastrophic, no.

What turns a small issue into a big one is panic. Clicking through settings you don't understand. Deleting things in frustration. Letting time pass while customers hit a broken page.

The calm approach is simple:

- Stop making changes
- Capture what you're seeing
- Ask for help from someone who knows how to interpret it

That's often all it takes to get things back on track.

If your site is showing a white screen or an error message right now, it doesn't mean you've failed or that your website is broken forever. It means something small has gone wrong in a complex system.

Those problems are fixable.

And you don't have to handle them alone.
