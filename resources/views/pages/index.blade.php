                <h2 class="size-5xl">When your website becomes a problem</h2>

                <p>Many websites start out fine and slowly degrade over time. Common issues I help clients with include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Slow websites that frustrate visitors and hurt conversions</li>
                    <li>Poor or under-performing SEO that makes your site hard to find</li>
                    <li>Broken WordPress sites, updates, or plugins</li>
                    <li>Websites that are difficult or risky to update</li>
                    <li>Designs that do not work properly on mobile devices</li>
                    <li>Layouts that break across browsers or screen sizes</li>
                    <li>Sites that no longer meet accessibility expectations</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If your site feels fragile or you are afraid to touch it in case something breaks, that is a strong sign it needs attention.</p>

                <h2 class="size-5xl">WordPress problems fixed properly</h2>

                <p>WordPress is powerful, but it can quickly become unstable when themes, plugins, and updates are poorly managed. I regularly repair WordPress websites that have broken after updates, suffered performance issues, or become bloated and unreliable over time.</p>
                <p>That may involve fixing plugin conflicts, cleaning up themes, improving performance, or recommending a safer long-term approach if WordPress is no longer the right fit.</p>

                <h2 class="size-5xl">Faster sites and better SEO</h2>

                <p>A slow website costs you visitors, rankings, and trust. I identify what is actually causing performance issues and fix them at the source, whether that is inefficient code, oversized assets, poor hosting, or unnecessary plugins.</p>
                <p>SEO issues often go hand in hand with performance and structure problems. I focus on practical improvements that help search engines understand your site better, from page structure and content hierarchy to technical foundations that support indexing and ranking.</p>

                <h2 class="size-5xl">Mobile-friendly and accessible again</h2>

                <p>If your site does not work well on phones and tablets, you are losing users. I fix layouts that break on smaller screens and rebuild problem areas so your website works properly across devices.</p>
                <p>Accessibility is also part of the process. Improving keyboard access, readable content, and overall usability makes your site work better for everyone and reduces future risk.</p>

                <p>My services are competitively and fairly priced, with a focus on solving real problems quickly. I do not upsell unnecessary rebuilds or long contracts unless they are genuinely the right solution.</p>
                <p>You deal directly with the person fixing your site, not a support queue or a junior developer. Clear communication, honest advice, and dependable results are part of the service.</p>
